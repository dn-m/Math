import Darwin

/// - Returns: A set of 0, 1, or 2 results of the quadratic equation for the given coefficients.
///
/// **Example Usage**
///
/// For a given equation `ax^2 + bx + c`, you can plug `a`, `b`, and `c` into the quadratic
/// equation.
///
/// For the given equataion `2x^2 + x + 3`, you would call:
///
///     let results = quadratic(2,1,3) // => []
///
/// In this case, there are no results.
///
/// For the given equation `5x^2 + 6x + 1`, you would call:
///
///     let results = quadratic(5,6,1) // => [-1, -0.2]
///
/// In this case, there are two results.
